## Contributing
At this time, I am not actively seeking contributions to the Prime Project. I appreciate your interest and enthusiasm for contributing to the project.

The reason for not actively seeking contributions is that I currently do not have well-defined ground rules and guidelines in place for contributors. I want to ensure that the contribution process is clear, fair, and productive for everyone involved.
However, I am always open to feedback, bug reports, and feature requests. If you encounter issues with the project or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to report in this project's repo issues page.

I value your interest in the project, and I may consider establishing contribution guidelines in the future. Until then, thank you for your understanding and support.
